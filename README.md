# rbk_nas_compare
A project to compare a Rubrik NAS (possibly fileset) backup to what exists on the source system

The first rev of this script is being developed for a parituclar customer so it may be of limited use outside of that.  If interest is clear for updates, I'll expand it as I do other projets.  Just an FYI.  Watch this space for official updates.
